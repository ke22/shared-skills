# {skill_title}

[TODO: Write a short opening summary in declarative sentences. Explain what this skill is for, what it does, and what it does not do. Do not force this summary into imperative voice.]

## Single responsibility

- Primary job: [TODO: the one main thing this skill owns]
- Not this skill's job: [TODO]
- Split / handoff rule: [TODO: if the request also needs X/Y, hand off or compose with another skill]

</success_criteria>

<workflow>
Step 0: Confirm inputs
- Action: Read the existing conversation/files first; ask follow-up questions only when a wrong assumption would materially change the outcome.

- Action: Run `python scripts/audit_workflow_contract.py . --json` to verify stop conditions, follow-through policy, and QA pass
- Action: Run `python scripts/audit_lifecycle_state.py . --json` to verify `skill_lifecycle.yaml`
- Action: Run `python scripts/audit_skill_references.py .` and `python scripts/audit_unreferenced_files.py .` to verify local paths and catch orphaned files
- Action: Update `references/readiness_report.md` with pass/fail status and evidence from the checks you ran
- Action: Use `references/checklist_template.md` only for manual review notes that cannot be mechanically gated
- Output: [TODO: final artifact + QA summary]

3. [TODO]

Formatting rules:
- [TODO: Markdown / JSON / SQL / table / etc.]
- [TODO: length limits]
- [TODO: whether extra sections are allowed]

</output_contract>

<tool_rules>
- [TODO: when to call which tool]
- [TODO: if a tool has side effects, state the approval rule]
- [TODO: if this skill is cross-host, define the minimal shared contract first; prefer conservative JSON Schema + MCP, then add OpenAPI only when needed]
- [TODO: if tool/function schema exists, make names, parameter descriptions, enum values, and required fields explicit]
- [TODO: put timeout / retry / idempotency / approval rules at the tool gateway layer instead of scattering them across host-specific prompts]
- [TODO: keep the active tool set as small as practical]
</tool_rules>

<default_follow_through_policy>
- Directly do: [TODO: low-risk, reversible, no external side effects]
- Ask first: [TODO: write operations, destructive actions, external side effects]

- Reasoning models: [TODO: goals, constraints, reasoning effort, what NOT to overspecify]
- Multi-turn split: [TODO: when to break analysis / execution / drafting / QA into separate turns]
</model_notes>

## Testing plan

### Triggering tests
- Golden trigger set:
  - Direct:
    - [TODO: obvious should-trigger prompt]
  - Indirect:
    - [TODO: paraphrase / near-miss that should still trigger]
  - Negative:
    - [TODO: similar prompt that should not trigger]
- Should trigger:
  - [TODO]
- Should NOT trigger:
  - [TODO]
- Near-miss / confusing cases:
  - [TODO]
- Should ask before acting:
  - [TODO]

### Functional tests
- Test case: [TODO]
  - Given:
  - When:
  - Then:

### Performance comparison (optional)
- Baseline (no skill):
- With skill:

### ROI guardrail
- Quality gain must justify extra:
  - Time:
  - Tokens:
  - Maintenance burden:

### Regression gates
- Minimum pass-rate delta:
- Maximum allowed time increase:
- Maximum allowed token increase:
- Maximum under-trigger failures:
- Maximum over-trigger failures:

### Feedback loop
- Common failure signals:
  - [TODO]
- Likely fix:
  - [TODO: description / workflow / resources]

### Model / routing checks
- GPT-style prompt pass:
  - [TODO]
- Reasoning-model pass:
  - [TODO]
- Neighbor-skill confusion:
  - [TODO]

### Host compatibility checks
- Primary host smoke tests:
  - [TODO]
- Wrapper / manifest / config drift review:
  - [TODO]
- Auth / approval / persistence checks:
  - [TODO]
- Known unsupported hosts:
  - [TODO]

## Eval workflow

- Save approved prompts to `assets/evals/evals.json`
- Define release thresholds in `assets/evals/regression_gates.json`
- Prepare paired runs with `python scripts/prepare_eval_workspace.py <path/to/skill>`
- If the environment supports subagents or parallel workers, launch with-skill and baseline runs in the same batch
- After runs complete, aggregate results and generate a review viewer
- Validate release thresholds with `python scripts/check_regression_gates.py <benchmark.json> --config assets/evals/regression_gates.json`

## Distribution notes

- Packaging: `python scripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>`
- Keep the core skill folder as the single source of truth; host-specific wrappers should stay thin
- Document supported hosts, auth requirements, approval boundaries, and persistence expectations outside the skill folder
- Repo-level README belongs *outside* this skill folder.

## Troubleshooting

- Symptom:
- Cause:
- Fix:

## Resources

This template includes optional resource directories:
- `scripts/` for deterministic helpers
- `references/` for long docs loaded on demand
- `references/readiness_report.md` is mandatory release evidence; keep it versioned and current
- `references/checklist_template.md` is a reusable manual review template, not a release gate
- `references/migration-governance.md` records rename/deprecate/merge/split compatibility rules
- `skill_lifecycle.yaml` records lifecycle state, ownership, review cadence, support matrix, risk, and dependencies
- `schemas/` records machine-readable contracts
- `policies/` records policy-as-code release, portability, and retirement rules
- `examples/` records example-as-test fixtures
- `assets/` for templates/fonts/icons used in output and reusable eval fixtures
"""

EXAMPLE_READINESS_REPORT = """# Readiness report

This file is release evidence for the current skill version.
It records mechanical gate results and must be updated whenever `SKILL.md`, scripts, references, or eval assets change.

## Final gate
- Current version reviewed: [TODO]
- Overall status: [PASS / FAIL / BLOCKED]
- Blocking issues:
  - [TODO]
- Evidence / commands run:
  - [TODO]
- Audit date: [TODO: YYYY-MM-DD]
- Git commit: [TODO: commit hash or local-only]
- Audit runner: [TODO: local / CI / host wrapper]

## Format checks
- [ ] Folder name is kebab-case
- [ ] `SKILL.md` exists (case-sensitive)
- [ ] YAML frontmatter starts/ends with `---`
- [ ] Frontmatter has `name` + `description`
- [ ] No `<` or `>` in frontmatter
- [ ] `references/readiness_report.md` is present and updated for this review
- [ ] `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` have no unexplained unreferenced files
- [ ] No `README.md` inside the skill folder

## Structure checks
- [ ] `<role>` exists as a real semantic block
- [ ] `<decision_boundary>` exists as a real semantic block
- [ ] `<workflow>` exists as a real semantic block
- [ ] Every workflow step has Action / Input / Output / Validation
- [ ] `<output_contract>` exists as a real semantic block
- [ ] `<default_follow_through_policy>` exists as a real semantic block
- [ ] At least one worked example exists and is not just a placeholder

## Eval and lifecycle checks
- [ ] `assets/evals/evals.json` exists
- [ ] `assets/evals/regression_gates.json` exists
- [ ] Trigger eval coverage includes should-trigger / should-not-trigger / near-miss
- [ ] Trigger eval coverage includes zh / en / mixed language cases
- [ ] Functional eval coverage includes happy path / edge case / failure mode
- [ ] Benchmark metadata requirements include skill version, git commit, host, model, timestamp, and grader version
- [ ] Version and audit date are not stale

## Manual review notes
- [ ] Triggers on obvious queries
- [ ] Triggers on paraphrases
- [ ] Does NOT trigger on unrelated queries
- [ ] Does NOT steal queries from neighboring skills
- [ ] Works on expected language variants
- [ ] If cross-tool, supported / unsupported hosts are explicitly documented
- [ ] Description clearly says when to use and when NOT to use the skill
- [ ] Skill has one clear primary job
- [ ] Instructions use imperative steps with input/output/validation
- [ ] Opening summary / Purpose / Scope paragraphs stay descriptive; only actionable instructions use imperative voice
- [ ] Core workflow works end-to-end
- [ ] Errors handled with actionable guidance
- [ ] Output matches required structure
- [ ] Output contract is explicit
- [ ] Default follow-through policy is explicit
- [ ] Examples exist when style/format quality matters
- [ ] Tool rules are explicit if the skill uses tools
- [ ] If cross-tool, the core skill pack is kept separate from host wrappers / manifests
- [ ] If cross-tool, auth / approval / persistence expectations are explicit
- [ ] Mutable state / cache / auth artifacts are NOT stored inside the skill folder

## Common error checks
- [ ] No missing local paths referenced from `SKILL.md` or `references/*.md`
- [ ] No unexplained orphan files remain in `scripts/`, `references/`, or `assets/`
- [ ] No contradictory rules between `SKILL.md`, `references/`, and `scripts/`
- [ ] No release-blocking `[TODO]` placeholders remain in user-facing instructions
- [ ] No hidden side effects bypass the stated follow-through policy
- [ ] Neighbor-skill overlap / negative triggers were reviewed after the latest changes
- [ ] Host wrappers do NOT fork or silently rewrite the core workflow

## Maintenance
- [ ] Version bumped in top-level version
- [ ] Changes documented (outside the skill folder, e.g., repo release notes)
- [ ] Evals saved to assets/evals/evals.json (if benchmarking this skill)
- [ ] Regression gates defined (if benchmarking this skill)
- [ ] ROI review completed
- [ ] Long workflows are split into stages or multi-turn steps when appropriate
- [ ] Model-specific notes added if GPT-style and reasoning models need different guidance

EXAMPLE_CHECKLIST_TEMPLATE = """# Manual review notes template

Use this file for reviewer judgment that is not yet safely mechanical.
Do not treat this template as release evidence; copy completed findings into `references/readiness_report.md`.

## Boundary review
- Does the skill own one intuitive primary job?
- Are neighboring skills and handoffs clear?
- Would a new user understand when not to use this skill?

## Trigger review
- Are trigger examples realistic?
- Are negative triggers specific enough?
- Are zh / en / mixed-language phrases covered where relevant?

## Output quality review
- Do worked examples teach the intended output quality?
- Is the output contract strict enough for repeatable results?
- Is the default follow-through policy clear about external side effects?

## Maintenance review
- Should this skill be renamed, merged, split, deprecated, or retired?
- Are wrappers thin enough to avoid host drift?
- Are release notes and public descriptions consistent with the skill folder?

EXAMPLE_MIGRATION_GOVERNANCE = """# Migration governance

This document defines evidence required before renaming, deprecating, merging, splitting, or retiring this skill.

## Rename
- Record old name, new name, reason, routing compatibility plan, package path impact, registry impact, and references checked.

## Deprecate
- Record deprecation reason, replacement skill or fallback workflow, effective date, removal date, user-facing notice, rollback condition, and eval impact.

## Merge
- Record source skills, target skill, boundary rationale, trigger conflict resolution, follow-through policy conflict resolution, eval migration, and wrapper updates.

## Split
- Record original skill, new target skills, routing boundary, handoff rules, eval redistribution plan, and compatibility aliases.

## Compatibility
- Check package paths, skill names, aliases, catalog entries, README links, registry entries, wrappers, local references, and benchmark workspaces.

## Migration Evidence
- Keep migration_type, from, to, effective_date, compatibility_policy, references_checked, evals_updated, wrappers_updated, and release_gate_result.
